# Simon Says — Modern Web Version

A modern, professional implementation of the classic *Simon Says* memory game built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Demo
Open `index.html` in a browser. No build step required.

## Features
- 4-color Simon board with clean, responsive UI
- Difficulty modes: **Easy**, **Normal**, **Hard**
- **Strict** mode (game restarts on mistake)
- Local highscore saved per difficulty in `localStorage`
- WebAudio-generated tones — no external sound files
- Accessible controls (keyboard support & ARIA)
- Dark mode toggle
- Clean, commented code ready for GitHub


## How to play
1. Click **Start** (or press Space / Enter).
2. Watch the colored sequence.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the pads in order.
4. Each correct round adds one more color. Aim for the highest level!

## Notes for developers
- Tones are generated by the Web Audio API (`app.js`). Some browsers require a user gesture for audio to start — pressing Start triggers the audio context.
- Highscores are stored as `simon_highscore_<difficulty>` in `localStorage`.

## Improvements / Next steps
- Add animations or visual particle effects.
- Add a shareable screenshot of your highscore.
- Add an audio on/off toggle or use better synthesized instrument waveforms.
